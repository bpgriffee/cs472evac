## Project Description
Our team hopes to ultize the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the problem of large scale evacuation of major cities in the case of an environmental disaster. Through leveraging accumulated traffic data and pre-existing route mapping technology we aim to create an application which will provide real time evacuation plans for individuals in a disaster zone.

### Motivation
In recent years, natural disasters have destroyed many communities in the United States and throughout the world. Thankfully, loss of life was significantly reduced, or completely prevented in many of these disasters by utilizing advanced warning systems and emergency broadcasts. However, we believe that with the gowing popularity of smart devices, we can reduce the impact of these disasters even further. Through efficient route planning, with specialzed considerations for natural disaster circumstances, our system will aim to supplement the emergency broadcast systems with real-time evacuation planning.
